# Texture-Image-Comparison
Exploring texture image processing with the Kylberg Texture Dataset, this project involves preprocessing, learning-free classification, and a multilayer perceptron. Metrics evaluate performance and compare methods. It was part of my uOttawa Master's in Computer Vision (2023).
